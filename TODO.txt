TODO

	If editor is not attached to project window, at least allow Switch to Counterpart
    Window -> Editor Tabs has things that don't make sense (and things that should be removed)
	Namespace everything (don't forget plugin.xml)
	DISABLE VERBOSE LOGGING
	PUBLISH

	(feature) Add file name at beginning of Breadcrumbs
	(feature) Show "Following First" indication in Breadcrumbs
	(feature) Put applicable actions in the project tree context menu

    (feature) Stop using "editor indexes"  Do everything relative.
        ("Swap" == "Move")
        Follow -> [Above, Below, Left, Right]

	(wish) Better handle horizontal splits

	(maybe?) Save following indexes?
