TODO

    Handle editor open & close (close done) for following indexes
	If editor is not attached to project window, at least allow Switch to Counterpart
    Window -> Editor Tabs has things that don't make sense (and things that should be removed)
	Save following indexes

	Check tracking multiple projects
	Namespace everything (don't forget plugin.xml)
	DISABLE VERBOSE LOGGING
	PUBLISH

	(feature) Add file name at beginning of Breadcrumbs
	(feature) Show "Following First" indication in Breadcrumbs
	(feature) Put applicable actions in the project tree context menu

	(wish) Better handle horizontal splits

	(maybe?) Stop using "editor indexes"  Get rid of "following" and do everything relative. "Swap" == "Move"
